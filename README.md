#### The SusPad is an open-source handheld retro-gaming computer. It is powered by a raspberry pi zero.

#### The purpous of this device is to allow for as much input customization as possible, by allowing the user to swap the physical inputs.

#### You could, for example, have an input module specifically for gameboy games, or another for DOS games, or even another one for Nintendo games. The opportunities are endless!

#### And of course, since this entire project is open source, you can even make your own motules!

#### Now, that begs the question: why is it among us themed?
#### Well, the simple answer to that is because I thought it would be funny to make an actual retro gaming handheld that was among us themed XD.
